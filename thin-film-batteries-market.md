These batteries are lightweight, flexible, and can be integrated into a variety of applications, including wearable electronics, medical devices, and smart cards.<br /><br />List of the Key Players in the Thin film Batteries Market:<br /><br />Enfucell, Jenax Inc., Molex LLC, NGK INSULATORS, LTD., Panasonic Energy Co., Ltd., ProLogium Technology CO., Ltd., Swatch Group, The Kurt J. Lesker Company, Ultralife Corporation and VARTA AG.<br /><br />Industry Development:<br /><br />In February 2024, Dutch startup LionVolt began developing innovative 3D solid-state batteries that incorporate a thin film with billions of solid pillars, creating a patented 3D structure with a large surface area. The company has also secured $16 million in funding to scale up production of these advanced batteries.<br /><br />In January 2024, battery startup BTRY raised CHF 900,000 in pre-seed funding to create high-performance thin-film solid-state batteries capable of charging and discharging in just one minute. The company has developed thin-film cells, only a few micrometers thick, into more powerful batteries using a high-precision vacuum coating process that eliminates the need for toxic solvents.<br /><br />Segment Covered in the Thin film Batteries Market:<br /><br />By Battery: Rechargeable, Disposable<br /><br />By Technology: Printed Battery, Ceramic Battery, Lithium Polymer Battery, Others<br /><br />By Voltage: Below 1.5 V, 1.5 to 3 V, Above 3 V<br /><br />By Capacity: Below 10 mAh, 10 to 100 mAh, Above 100 mAh<br /><br />By Application: Consumer Electronics, Medical Devices, Smart Packaging, Smart Cards, Wireless Sensors, Others<br /><br />People Also Ask:</p>
